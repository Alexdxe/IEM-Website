st.markdown("## 🚩Introduction:")
st.markdown("The Moondrop Variations have long been touted as one of the greatest IEMs in the $500~ price range. With its spectacular tonal balance and class-leading technical performance, it’s no wonder many people fell in love with it at the time. However, it's been almost 4 years since the Variations were initially released, and with how competitive the market is, does this legend still stand up to the greats of today")

st.markdown("## 📦Accessories/Intangables:")
st.markdown("The Variations come in this strange cube-like box, with a nice assortment of accessories that feel a little dated. The package includes a 2-strand copper braided cable that is memory-free and fairly light. The cable also has interchangeable connectors for 2.5 and 4.4, allowing it to run any source you throw at it. The IEM also comes bundled with a cylindrical hard case, which can fit about one IEM. The odd shape and width of the case keep me from potentially grabbing it, but I applaud Moondrop for trying something new and unique. The IEMs include a set of tips, with small, medium, and large sizes of both foam and silicone. Personally, I am not a fan of either of the tips, but I do like that they are packaged in a plastic hard case. Other, less notable inclusions are a postcard and an airplane adapter. The Moondrop Variations themselves are encased in a sandblasted metal face plate, alongside a resin shell. While I have no glaring issues with the build, the hollow resin shell is a bit concerning, as it leads to possibilities of users cracking the case itself, leading to the drivers being completely exposed. The fit can run a little large on some people. When you are shoving this many drivers into a shell, naturally, your IEM will be a little tall. Overall, the IEM’s accessory line-up is acceptable, but nothing to write home about.")

st.markdown("## 🔊Overall Sound:")
st.markdown("If I were to tell someone to imagine what an audiophile headphone would sound like, I think most would describe something along the lines of the Moondrop Variations. It’s clean, has incredible detail retrieval, and has enough bass/treble brilliance to make the IEM sound engaging. It’s a signature that most would enjoy, and one many would have little problems with.")

st.markdown("## 💣Bass:")
st.markdown("Diving into more of the specifics, the bass on this IEM will be a love it or hate it for most. The Variations have a sub-bass-focused signature, resulting in the IEM still having a distinct bass shelf, while not warming up the rest of the mix. The quality is quite strong as well, hitting deep on the right tracks. To put it simply, the sub-bass focus helps give the Variations a sense of both clarity and impact, aiding in the clean signature’s goal.")

st.markdown("## 🎤Mids:")
st.markdown("The mid-range of the IEM is its star quality, with its focus on the upper-mid range giving female vocals a natural, extended, and forward presentation. Listening to energetic genres like Kpop/Jpop on these is a treat, as everything comes off just slightly more clean and clear, with vocals singing as they have never before. However, with such a heavy female/vocal emphasis, male voices sound slightly thin and anemic as a result. While not a problem when listening to faster and more upbeat tracks, it becomes a concern on slower tracks, where warmth may take precedence.")

st.markdown("## ☁️Treble:")
st.markdown("The Variations treble is smooth and ever so slightly forward. It complements the rest of the mix well, with no noticeable peaks or dips upon listening. The treble helps further emphasize just how natural the Variation’s timbre is, and further cements the Variations as one of the best-tuned IEMs.")

st.markdown("## 🔎Details:")
st.markdown("With such a clinical signature, naturally, the technical performance is bound to be quite stellar. The Moondrop Variations is such a resolving IEM. When listening to live performances of songs, it almost feels like you are there in the crowd, with a wide stage, great detail retrieval, and impeccable instrumental separation. The Variations is just a complete powerhouse on almost all fronts, with the technical performance only proving its case further.")

st.markdown("## 🆚Comparisons(B2D, Dusk, Nova):")
st.markdown("#### Variations vs Blessing 2 Dusk:")
st.markdown("The Blessing 2 Dusk is a great all-arounder set that really does no wrong. It has enough bass, a reference-like mid-range, and great treble extension/detail performances for the price. However, I felt the Moondrop wanted to position the Variations as a direct upgrade to the Blessing 2 Dusk, as not only is it more detailed, but its tuning feels more refined. While it is thinner, the mid-range sounds more natural, and its treble is less peaky, in part thanks to the Variations smoothening the 5k peak that the Blessing 2 Dusk had. While the Variations are ~$200 more than the Blessing 2 dusk, it is an upgrade in both tonality and technical performance.")
st.markdown("#### Variations vs Dusk:")
st.markdown("While the Blessing 2 Dusk has been discontinued, the Moondrop Dusk has since replaced it. Being tuned to the Meta/ JM-1 Target, the Dusk sounds far more natural and thick than the Variations, which can be a positive or negative depending on your preferences. However, what is undeniable is that for $100 less, you are getting 6 different tunings in the IEM, with one being the Harman target, the same as the Variations. For the money, I still think the Moondrop Dusk is simply the end-game IEM for most. It has everything you would want in a single device: its own power source, different tunings, and a beautiful-looking shell. Simply put, the Variations may beat the Dusk in sheer perfection of the Harman target and detail retrieval, but the Dusk has the Variations beat in naturalness, bass performance, value, and versatility.")
st.markdown("#### Variations vs Nova:")
st.markdown("Lastly, one of the most popular picks for IEMs under $200 is the Truthears Nova, which many have touted as a mini version of Variations. While they graph fairly similarly, they do not sound the same. The Variations is superior in every single way, with the most notable difference being how the Nova sounds even thinner than the Variations. With less sub-bass and more treble, the Nova comes off as more “studio” and becomes a fairly sterile listening experience. However, I can absolutely ignore most of these problems purely because it achieves about 80% of the Variations performance for about ⅓ of the price. While the Variations is clearly the better IEM, the value of the Nova is clear. If you are looking for a faithful reproduction of the target, the Nova is a great buy.")

st.markdown("## 🏁Conclusion:")
st.markdown("Although the Variations dominated its price bracket a few years ago, the IEM market is a vastly different landscape than it was in 2021. With releases like the Truthers Nova nearly replicating its signature for ⅓ of the price, the Dusk being more versatile for slightly less, and the overall market churning out better-tuned IEMs by the month, the Variations face stiff competition from below. If you want the absolute best representation of the Harman target and a fun IEM to listen to, the Variations is still one of the best on the market today. However, if you want to get the most out of your money, you'd better look elsewhere.")
