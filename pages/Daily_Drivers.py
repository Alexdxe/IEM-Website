Not only has it been lauded for it's natural DSP-default tuning, but all of it's other tunings (analog, bassy, V-Shape, Harman, etc.) are also fantastic. Personally, the DSP tuning may be the best IEM I have in my collection overall, blending a natural midrange, tight bass, and detailed treble into one neutral yet engaging sound signature.")
