st.markdown("## 🚩Introduction:")
st.markdown("Softears is a brand known for making IEMs that are usually only affordable to the most devout enthusiasts. Models like the RSV, Cerberus, and RS10 demonstrate that Softears is targeting those with richer taste, to put it very lightly. But within their catalog, there are 2 IEMs that, while not affordable, are definitely leagues cheaper than their other offerings. I am talking about the Volume and Volume S, both sets, I fully believe have a niche or still compete in today's market.")

st.markdown("## 📦Accessories/Intangables:")
st.markdown('#### Volume:')
st.markdown("Overall, the Volume comes with a nice selection of accessorires. It comes with a nice black double stranded cable, 6 pairs of silicone case, a cleaning tool, and a nice leather hard case. Interestingly, the IEM also comes with a metal card of sorts, so you can show off that you own the Volume. Lastly, the shells are made of a 3D filled resin for the shell, and an aluminum faceplate. I enjoy the unique green colorway they decided with for the IEM, as it stands out within my collection. A great selection of inclusions for the price.")
st.markdown('')
st.markdown('##### Volume S:')
st.markdown("The Volume S comes with better accessories than the Volume, including a hefty twin braided cable, 6 pairs of silicone tips (including their UC tips), an adapter for 4.4mm, a hard leather zipcase, and a cleaning tool. Most importantly, this IEM also comes with a tool to help give you a different sound signature, however we will not be discussing it because it's worse than the default tuning. The shell is a mix of materials this time, with the 3D filled resin housing remaining the same. However, Softears opted to mix the aluminum faceplate with a inlay of forged carbon fiber, creating a striking design. Overall, a really impressive spread of accessorries.")

st.markdown("## 🔊Overall Sound:")
st.markdown('#### Volume:')
st.markdown("The Volume is an IEM with an emphasis on sub-bass and the upper-mid range, giving it a V-Shape sound profile. While this may deter some who have tried V-shape offerings from brands like KZ or other cheap brands, the Volume does this tastefully through a few key differences.")
st.markdown('')
st.markdown('#### Volume S:')
st.markdown("The Volume S, on the other hand, is an IEM tuned with the new JM-1 Target in mind, a sound signature that mostly emphasizes a richer, warmer tone. Funnily enough, I would argue that Volume S is almost the opposite of what they were trying to go for with the original Volume. ")


st.markdown("## 💣Bass:")
st.markdown("#### Volume:")
st.markdown("The bass is done modestly on this set, as it has plenty of impact to satisfy most people not named bass-heads. The bass quality is great, as it’s not bloated or “puffy”, but rather hits with distinction. Bass is more focused on sub-bass rather than mid-bass, but that’s not to say it’s lacking in either.")
st.markdown('')
st.markdown("#### Volume S:")
st.markdown("While we saw that the Volume was more focused on the sub-bass, the Volume S puts a larger emphasis on the mid-bass. It should be noted that overall, the Volume S comes off as the more bassier set. Its quality of bass is a step above the original, hitting harder and with a satisfying level of tactility. The best part is that despite this amount of mid-bass, there is no bleed whatsoever into the mids. The attack is clean and well separated from the vocalists.")


st.markdown("## 🎤Mids:")
st.markdown("#### Volume:")
st.markdown("It seems that Softears made this set with the idea of it being a vocal-forward IEM first and foremost. It strikes this beautiful balance of being Harman-inspired, yet avoids all the pitfalls of Harman tuning, like thinness and shoutiness, thanks to the amount of warmth coming in from the lower-mids and mid-bass. The Volume has a lot of upper mids, pushing vocals front and center. This almost makes vocalists sometimes feel detached from the rest of the mix. While on certain ballads, the Volume can come off shouty, for the most part, vocals and timbre are natural.")
st.markdown('')
st.markdown("#### Volume S:")
st.markdown("Vocals are fantastic on this set as well. While not nearly as forward as on the original, vocals are more organic. On slower tracks, the Volume S really shines, presenting a rich, warm mid-range while not being husky in any way. The IEM almost feels comforting to listen to, as the thicker presentation lends to a less aggressive signature overall. However, there is one flaw to note about the vocals, and that is their soundstage. Vocals feel cramped or boxed in. While this doesn’t affect the overall naturalness, it makes vocals feel somewhat cut off. This is kinda similar to the case of the original Volume; however, Volume S only has this problem in the vocals, and not the whole mix.")

st.markdown("## ☁️Treble:")
st.markdown("#### Volume:")
st.markdown("When swapping between different IEMs during casual listening, it’s hard to ignore the lack of treble extension these IEMs have. It’s by far the biggest, most glaring issue from what is mostly a fantastic IEM. The lack of extension almost makes it feel like I’ve lost certain details when I’m listening to music. Vocalists feel cut off, and other details in the music don’t feel as apparent as they would if I were listening to an IEM like the Variations, which has proper treble extension. However, the treble is smooth and avoids having too many peaks, making it at least non-fatiguing and pleasant to listen to.")
st.markdown('')
st.markdown("#### Volume S:")
st.markdown("Treble is fairly unnoteworthy. That’s not to say it’s bad, but rather neither terrific nor terrible. It’s smooth and definitely has more extension than the original, which is a big upgrade. It’s natural, devoid of peaks, and well extended. While some would argue that it may be too relaxed, I think the way the treble is done perfectly complements the rest of the mix, being more laid-back and warm in presentation. ")


st.markdown("## 🔎Details:")
st.markdown("#### Volume:")
st.markdown("As mentioned in the treble, the lack of extension really hurts this set’s overall perception of detail. I don’t think it is as detailed as an IEM in its price bracket today, and it is likely of equal quality to something like the Truthears Nova, or slightly worse. If you are buying the Volume, purchase it with tuning in mind.")
st.markdown('')
st.markdown("#### Volume S:")
st.markdown("For the price, the Volume S fights with the rest of its peers. I would argue it has about the same resolving levels as, if not less than, the Moodrop Dusk. Dynamics are the highlight in this IEM, as the bass quality gives music a bouncy and lively feel to the mix.")

st.markdown("## 🆚Comparisons(Eachother, Dusk):")
st.markdown("#### Volume vs Volume S:")
st.markdown("Jumping into the comparison segment, first, let’s compare both IEMs side by side. This is more of a short and brief summary of each IEM, since I went into great detail about both earlier.  The Volume is a much brighter, livelier listen, with far more energy in both sub-bass and upper mid-range. In comparison, the Volume S takes a much warmer approach, instead emphasizing the lower mids and mid-bass. While both of these IEMs trade blows, there is one thing that sets the Volume S a step ahead of the original, and that is the treble. You really do notice that treble roll off when swapping back between IEMs with a more extended treble response like the Variations. I dislike that it feels like certain details are being cut off from the IEM, which is why I prefer Volume S’s more extended and (not to mention) smooth treble. However, I feel like it’s not entirely fair to compare the two IEMs as if they are equals because while the original Volume does retail for $285, it often goes on sale for $200. This effectively makes the price gap between the two ~$100, which at that price, I can more justifiably justify the soso treble response from the Volume.")
st.markdown("")
st.markdown("#### Volume/S vs Moondrop Dusk:")
st.markdown("One of the biggest competitors to both Volumes is the Moondrop Dusk, a $400 IEM that is considered a benchmark in today’s market. While pricey for the tuning you are paying for today, it’s still an amazing IEM nonetheless, and is one of the IEMs I grab the most in my collection. I will be taking into account just the DSP-Default tuning. While comparing the three, I would say that overall, the Volume is just a step below all of these in all categories. While its tuning is certainly unique and stands out, it is defeated by both sets in terms of dynamics, naturalness, and technical performance.")
st.markdown("The more interesting comparison would be between the Volume S and the Dusk, which both have taken inspiration from the JM-1 Target. The Dusk comes off as the more neutral set, having a fairly balanced tuning outside of the upper treble peak, which helps with micro-details and adds a bit of aggressiveness to what would’ve been a plain signature. However, the Volume S leans into being a more colored sound, having both more warmth and smoother treble. There’s no real winner between the two as they both trade blows in different categories. The Dusk wins in Upper-mids, Treble, and micro-details, while the Volume S excels with bass, lower-mids, and dynamics. It comes down to what you prefer and want in an IEM, but if I had to choose, it would be the Dusk. I find its signature to be a lot more versatile, and even if the Volume S has the better bass, the Dusk is also no slouch in that department.")

st.markdown("## 🏁Conclusion:")
st.markdown("In a market of copy and paste JM-1 and Harman-tuned IEMs, I think the Volume and Volume S stand out in the market by taking inspiration from their respective targets, but with a twist. The Volume is a Harman/V-Shape IEM with an upper-mid range emphasis, whose tuning has yet to be duplicated since its release back in 2022. On the other hand, the Volume S is a new meta IEM that adds a ton of mid-bass and extra warmth to make it stand out from the other IEMs with the same tuning. It’s funny, while both IEMs are essentially opposites in terms of tuning philosophy, they are a lot more similar than you think. If you can grab the Volume during sales for $200, I highly suggest at least trying it, as while it does not compete nearly as well with the competition today, it is a great option at the price range. The Volume S, on the other hand, is still quite competitive today and is definitely an IEM you should consider if you want something thicker and fun. If you are tired of the cookie-cutter “good” IEMs, I highly advise you to seek out one or both of these IEMs and give them a try.")
